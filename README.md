# Twitter-Disaster-Analysis
In this project we have analyzed the classification of tweets to determine whether they are disaster related or not.

Importance:
Relevance of Social Media: During emergencies, social media platforms like Twitter become crucial for spreading information in real time.
Prioritization of Information: By accurately determining which tweets are related to disasters, it's possible to organize and prioritize them. This is vital for emergency responders and teams, who can then better allocate their efforts and resources.
Improvement of Crisis Management: Effective classification of tweets enhances overall crisis response strategies. It leads to more efficient use of resources and, critically, the preservation of life.


# Difference from other projects 
Our project utilizes a wider array of methodologies, such as deep learning and ensemble methods, beyond those explored in the referenced studies.
A key focus of our research is on the interpretability and explainability of models, aiming to make the decision-making process in disaster tweet analysis comprehensible and trustworthy for all interested parties.
Unlike previous studies, our work incorporates user engagement metrics and social network analysis to examine into the dynamics and impact of tweets during disasters, providing additional insights from social and behavioral aspects.
